                I am a fourth-year BTech student in Computer Science and have a strong passion for Frontend Development. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and have developed several projects that showcase my ability to create responsive and visually appealing web applications.
                My education has provided me with a solid foundation in computer science concepts and programming languages, and I am eager to apply these skills in a professional setting. I am looking for an internship where I can continue to learn and grow as a Frontend Developer, while working on meaningful projects that challenge me and help me develop my skills further.
